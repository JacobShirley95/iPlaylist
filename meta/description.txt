This extension was born out of the need to watch BBC iPlayer shows in sequence, rather than having to manually change which show to watch next. 

At the moment it's pretty basic: you can visit any show on the BBC iPlayer website and add it to a playlist; you can have multiple playlists, however, only one playlist can be played at a time; adding and deleting of items in a playlist; and forwards and backwards  control buttons.

Future additions may include: universal playlist functionality, which would include being able to add media from YouTube, ITV, Channel 4, etc; playing of the "Add to Playlist" button in other pages of the BBC iPlayer website; restyling of the theme (it's pretty basic right now); more controls buttons; and more.
